# Pyber_Analysis

# Pyber_Challenge_JupyterNotebook
# Overview
Using Python and knowledge of Pandas, I've created DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for Pyber. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# Analysis
The analysis for Pyber was done for Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. From the analysis, drivers in the urban areas make significantly less than suburban and rural area rides. However, in average. drivers in rural areas make more than the rides taken in suburban and rural areas

- Rural: 125*55.49 = average $6936.25
- Suburban: 625*39.50 = avg $24687.5
- Urban: 1625*16.57 = avg $26926.25

# Conclusion 
Drivers in urban area can charge less because of two big reasons. 
 - They get significantly more rides compared to the rural and suburban areas due to population. (Demand and supply)
 - The proximity of destinations within the city is closer compared to rural and suburban areas
However, we are lacking data on the demand in the rural and suburban areas. Usually, there aren't enough drivers in these areas when passengers request it. More drivers should be sent out to suburban and rural areas to capitalize on the amount they can be made.
